Bit of a brain dump but here goes;


All messages are asynchronous. E.g. the UI will ask the EDTracker to
recenter by sending an R
The Arduino will recenter and then send an R back to the UI at which point
the UI knows that
recentering is complete.

This is the same for the majority of commands. The UI doesn't change state
when it send the command  it only changes when it gets the response from
the Arduino.

Floating point values are exchanged as fixed point integers (int16).
So there are places below where a float will be multiplied then cast as an
int16 and split into two bytes for transmission.

I can can into details on the calibration maths after you've had a chance
to digest this lot.


*Messages From UI to Arduino*

H Hello - prompt the arduino to say Hello back.
V Verbose - turns on serial output from Arduino
I Info - arduino sends basic sketch/config data back to UI
S sshhh  tells the Arduino to stop talking over serial.  Sent by UI when
minimised or closed.

B Calc Bias values. Tells Arduino to calculate gyro/accel bias values.
t  Tell arduino to toggle response mode (linear , exponential).
p  Tell arduino to toggle polling/interrupt mode
0 (zero) Restore Factory settings on Arduino.

M/m  Increment/Decrement gyro x axis bias
N/n   Increment/Decrement gyro y axis bias
O/o  Increment/Decrement gyro z axis bias

j/J Increment/Decrement accel x axis bias
k/K Increment/Decrement accel y axis bias
l/L Increment/Decrement accel z axis bias

c/C Nudge yaw scale down by either 0.25  or 1.0
d/G Nudge yaw scale up by either 0.25  or 1.0

e/E Nudge pitch scale down by either 0.25  or 1.0
f/F Nudge pitcg scale up by either 0.25  or 1.0

R Recentre View
# Toggle autocentre behaviour (6050 only)

D Save current drift compensation (6050 only)
P Toggle orientation (increments 0 to 6 then wraps back to 0 - see below)
A/a   Nudge Drift Compensation up/down

C <int16>x3 encoded as 6 bytes followed by a terminator (10)
(yawscale * 256)
(pitchscale*256)
(Low Pass Filter * 327.67)
10

$     <int16> x 21
The biggie! This send two 3x3 matrices followed by 3 mag offset values
(x,y,z)
The values are all floats encoded as fixed point int16s (two bytes),i.e the
float values are muiltiplied by a fixed value then cast as int16.

<int16>x3 Mag Offsets for x,y,z  ( float multiplied by 64)
<int16>x9 Orientated Mag Calibration Matrix ( float multiplied by 8192)
<int16>x9 UnOrientated Mag Calibration Matrix ( float multiplied by 8192)


*Messages From Arduino to UI*

S Indicates Arduino is in silent mode (no serial output).
H   Hello from Arduino.  UI then sends a V (to put it into Verbose mode and
I to get basic info
h   Hello from Arduino while it's auto calibration (Hi but I'm busy...)

a   bias adjust enabled for all axis
x   bias adjust only enabled for x axis
y bias adjust only enabled for y axis
z bias adjust only enabled for z axis

V   Inidcates Arduino now in Verbose mode and talking to UI

Messages that Return Data From Arduino. Data is tab separated

M <string> Generic message from Arduino (single string)

q <float> x 12  Magnetometer calibration Matrix and offset data;

Three values which are the ag Offset for  X,Y & Z
followed by 9 values which form a 3x3 Matrix

Q  <float> x 3  Latest raw (uncalibrated) Magnetometer values (x/y/z)
These are stored and later used to determine the x/y/z ofsets and
calibration matrix.

s (lower case) <int> <float> <float>
Response scaling mode (0 is linear, 1 is exponential) followed by
pitch scaling and then yaw scaling

p <int>   1 indicated arduino is Polling sensors, 0 indicated using
interrupts

# <int>  Auto recenter mode;
0= offset
1= Soft
2=Medium
3=Hard

I  <string> Info about current sketch version etc.
NB This message is send by Arduino once auto calibration is complete (no
longer too busy to talk to UI)

D <float> < float>    Yaw Drift followed by current Yaw Drift Compensation

T <float>   Sensor  temperature reading.

O <int>  Device Orientation;
0 Top/USB Right
1 Top/USB Front
2 Top/USB Left
3 Top/USB Rear
4 Left/USB Down
5 Right/USB Down

NB After receiving one of these 'orientation changed' messages the UI has
to apply
a rotation to the raw mag calibration matrix and push that matrix back up
to the Arduino

R Device has recentered

B   <int> x6   CUrremt gyro and acceleromter bias values;
Gyro Bias X, Y Z
Accel  Bias X, Y Z

None of the above;

If a line is recieved over serial which does not start with a command then
it will be a 'live data' message;
<float> x3  Yaw/Pitch/Roll
<int>   x3 Accelerometer X/Y/Z
<float> x3 gyro X/Y/Z

These pitch and yaw values are used to rotate the UI Head.

The Processing project loaded up and ran at the first time of asking. The 3=
D head flickers like no-one&#39;s business, but other than that it seemed t=
o connect to the arduino and extract data without problem.<br>
<br>
The issue came when trying to compile a release version -- serial access ca=
used it to freeze on startup. Apparently this is a bug in Processing 2.2.1 =
for OSX which was not present in 2.1.2. Alas 2.1.2&#39;s no longer availabl=
e for download.<br>
<br>
2.2.1 is Java 1.7 so I thought I&#39;d see if I could get it workign in Pro=
cessing 3, which uses Java 1.8.<br>
<br>
There&#39;s been a change somewhere (either in Java itself or in the libs) =
that a PApplet can no longer be a parameter to add() (needs a Component typ=
e), but that was the only problem. I tried just commenting that out for now=
 and the program could run and seemingly behave normally although couldn&#3=
9;t be properly terminated (presumably as it didn&#39;t have a reference to=
 the secondApplet).<br>
<br>
Unfortuntely I saw the same behaviour on export as I had in 2.2.1, so eithe=
r this bug is still firmly in place in the Processing libraries, or that mi=
ssing reference to the secondApplet is causing different behaviour outside =
of the IDE.<br>
<br>
Changing tack, I went back to my native Mac test project and added some bas=
ic support for talking to the serial port and having got it to the stage of=
 exchanging greetings, thought I&#39;d call that a night.<br>
<br>
Next I&#39;ll see if I can produce debugging output for the various serial =
line cases I can see listed in the java program unless you think it&#39;d b=
e worth persisting with the conversion to Processing v3?<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve not followed through all the logic as to what gets sent back to th=
e Arduino or the maths behind it as yet.<br>
<br>

Hi David,<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve attached a zip with the old processing project (main file is<br>
EDTrackerUtil221pde)=C2=A0<br>
<br>
It kinda works on Windows with a new EDTracker 9150 =C2=A0- I get a moving =
head<br>
and some raw data being displayed so if that works in any way on Mac then<b=
r>
it&#39;s a good start and we can have a crack at updating.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I&#39;ll have a crack at setting up the processing IDE=
