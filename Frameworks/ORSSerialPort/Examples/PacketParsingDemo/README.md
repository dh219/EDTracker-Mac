The PacketParsingDemo app demonstrates the use of the ORSSerialPort packet parsing API (`ORSSerialPacketDescriptor`, etc.). Code is available for an [Arduino Esplora](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardEsplora) to act as the device this app is designed to communicate with. The Arduino Esplora code can be found in this repository: [https://github.com/armadsen/ArduinoPacketSend](https://github.com/armadsen/ArduinoPacketSend) .

Both Swift and Objective-C versions of this example application are included. The functionality is identical in both versions.

For more information about the packe tparsing API and this example project, please see the [Packet Parsing API documentation](https://github.com/armadsen/ORSSerialPort/wiki/Packet-Parsing-API).
