# Change Log
All notable changes to ORSSerialPort are documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

##[Unreleased]
This section is for changes commited to the ORSSerialPort repository, but not yet included in an official release.

##[2.0.2] - 2016-03-14

###CHANGED
- Refactored packet descriptor buffer parsing to pave the way for future improvements (thanks @nathanntg!)
- Clarified distinction between packet parsing API and request/response API in documentation for `ORSSerialPacketDescriptor`.
- Refactored modem line control code (see Issue #86 and commit 6fc0c9e)

###FIXED
- Fixed error building framework project in Xcode 4.6 on 10.7.5
- Fixed bug where PacketParsingDemo and RequestResponseDemo apps didn't work on 10.11
- Fixed incorrect nullability annotation on `ORSSerialRequest`'s `responseDescriptor` property

##[2.0.1] - 2015-09-26

###ADDED
- Added CHANGELOG.md file
- Travis CI now builds and tests changes to ORSSerialPort's public repository

###FIXED
- Fixed error when building framework project (tests target specifically) in versions of Xcode before support for nullability annotations were introduced.

##[2.0.0] - 2015-09-21

Version 2.0.0 is a major update to ORSSerialPort. It includes enhancements including a new packet parsing API, bug fixes, performance improvements, and additional example code.

It is mostly API compatible with previous releases, requiring no code changes on the part of most users. The exception is that the methods for creating an ORSSerialRequest object have changed slightly. The old methods are deprecated, but still available.

Important note: Due to a change to the underlying system API used by ORSSerialPort, as of this release, it only supports deploying to OS X 10.7 or later. If you require support for OS X 10.6, use version 1.8.2. The requirements for building ORSSerialPort (Xcode 4.4+ on 10.7+) have not changed.

###ADDED
- Added full featured packet parsing API. `ORSSerialPacketDescriptor`, etc. See []documentation](https://github.com/armadsen/ORSSerialPort/wiki/Packet-Parsing-API)
- Added ability to cancel pending requests
- Added Objective-C generics annotations for nicer usability from Swift
- Added PacketParsingDemo app (Swift and Objective-C)
- Added some unit tests

###DEPRECATED
No API has been _removed_, but a few methods have been deprecated their use should be replaced as soon as possible:

- Existing `ORSSerialRequest` initializer (and corresponding convenience method), `-[ORSSerialRequest initWithDataToSend:userInfo:timeoutInterval:responseEvaluator:]` has been deprecated. Use `-initWithDataToSend:userInfo:timeoutInterval:responseDescriptor:` instead.
- Deprecated `-[ORSSerialRequest dataIsValidRespone:]`. If this functionality is needed, use the request's packet descriptor's `-dataIsValidPacket:` method instead.

###REMOVED
- Removed support for deploying to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Those who need to continue deploying to 10.6 should use version 1.8.2. Version 2.0.0 will deploy to 10.7 or higher.


###CHANGED
- Request / response API response detection has been rewritten to use new packet parsing API.
- `ORSSerialPort` now uses a dispatch source for reading from the underlying serial device
- Converted all Swift demo apps to Swift 2.0
