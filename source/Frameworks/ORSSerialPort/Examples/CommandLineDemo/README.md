CommandLineDemo is a Foundation-based command line program demonstrating the use of ORSSerialPort in applications without a GUI. It is available in both Objective-C and Swift.

ORSSerialPortCommandLineDemo is a very simple serial terminal. It lists the available ports, allows the user to select one, and enter a baud rate. After that, typed input is sent out on the serial port, and data received from the port is printed to the console. 

It was written quickly and is primarily intended simply as demonstration that such an app is possible rather than as a starting point for production code. The source code for the entire program is contained in main.m (Objective-C version) or main.swift (Swift version).
